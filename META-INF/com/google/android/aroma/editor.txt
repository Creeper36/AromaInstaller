About STweaks
-----------------
!!ONLY WORKING WITH ALUCARD KERNEL!!-Expert user only!

STweaks is a powerful tool which can boost or destroy your device
if you dont know what to do.
Please select STweaks ONLY if you know what you are really doing
When installing STweaks you can also install kernel adiutor from Play Store
Although you have to NOT ENABLE THE OPTION *APPLY ON BOOT* from it.
Kernel adiutor overwrites the STweaks edits.That means any STweaks 
edit will be deleted on next reboot if you have enabled
*APPLY ON BOOT* at kernel adiutor.

For every change you do to Stweaks press the button *APPLY SETTINGS TO GOV CORE*
from the tab CPU-TUNING and wait for the toast message.
Then press *LOAD ALL* from CPU tab and wait 10 seconds until STweaks reboots

STweaks is applying the edits before init.d
Stweaks will rarely be unable to show the UI even if you gave SU previleges.
(this happens because something went wrong due to bad user edits).
All you got to do is to press on top right,Settings,Theme chooser and change theme
just to refresh the interface.

This editor can FULLY edit the alucard kernel.
Kernel adiutor cannot.

About Kernel Adiutor
----------------------
Works on both kernels.A universal tool that can edit the kernels.
Keep in mind that the expert edits of alucard's kernel wont be able
just like in STweaks.Supposed to be stabler and more updated.

None.I trust the developer
---------------------------
Use none of those editors.This is recommended for novice users.
